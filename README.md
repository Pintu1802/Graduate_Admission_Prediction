# Graduate_Admission_Prediction

Project Title: Graduate Admission Prediction Using Keras Regression Deep Learning ANN

Project Description:

Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict the likelihood of admission for graduate programs based on various factors using a deep learning model built with Keras.

Dataset:
The project will use a dataset containing various attributes such as GRE scores, TOEFL scores, university rating, statement of purpose, letter of recommendation strength, undergraduate GPA, and research experience.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize the data, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
Model Development: A regression deep learning model will be developed using Keras with TensorFlow backend. The model will have multiple hidden layers with activation functions such as ReLU and a linear output layer.
Training: The model will be trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process will involve optimizing the model's weights using the Adam optimizer and minimizing the mean squared error loss function.
Evaluation: The trained model will be evaluated using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and R-squared value to assess its performance in predicting admission likelihood.
Prediction: The model will be used to predict the likelihood of admission for new data samples.
Expected Outcome:
The project aims to build a regression deep learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of admission for graduate programs based on the input features. The model's performance will be evaluated, and insights will be drawn from the analysis.
